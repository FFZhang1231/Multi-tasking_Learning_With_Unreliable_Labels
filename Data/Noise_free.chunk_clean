a	b-np

the	b-np

most	b-adjp

abuse	b-np

With	b-pp
a	b-np
market	i-np

,	o
an	b-np

``	o

It	b-np
may	b-vp
also	i-vp
stipulate	i-vp

In	b-pp
looking	b-vp
at	b-pp
these	b-np

other	i-np
policies	i-np
,	o
I	b-np
learn	b-vp
to	i-vp
ask	i-vp
pointed	b-np
questions	i-np
about	b-pp
some	b-np
of	b-pp
the	b-np
assumptions	i-np
built	b-vp
into	b-pp
``	o

--	o
the	b-np

my	b-np
cash	i-np
values	i-np
over	b-pp
the	b-np

They	b-np
commonly	b-advp
give	b-vp
two	b-np
scenarios	i-np
:	o
One	b-np
is	b-vp
based	i-vp
on	b-pp
interest	b-np
rates	i-np
that	b-np
the	b-np
company	i-np
guarantees	b-vp
(	o
usually	b-advp
4	b-np
%	i-np
to	i-np
4.5	i-np
%	i-np
)	o
and	o
the	b-np
other	i-np
on	b-pp
the	b-np
rate	i-np
it	b-np
is	b-vp
currently	i-vp
getting	i-vp
on	b-pp
investment	b-np
,	o
often	b-advp
8.5	b-np
%	i-np
or	i-np
more	i-np
.	o

Projecting	b-vp
the	b-np
latter	i-np
over	b-pp
several	b-np
decades	i-np
,	o
I	b-np
find	b-vp
my	b-np
cash	i-np
buildup	i-np
is	b-vp
impressive	b-adjp
--	o
but	o
can	o
any	b-np
high	i-np
interest	i-np
rate	i-np
prevail	b-vp
for	b-pp
that	b-np
long	i-np
?	o

Not	b-adjp
likely	i-adjp
,	o
I	b-np
think	b-vp
.	o

Also	b-advp
,	o
some	b-np
policy	i-np

assume	b-vp
that	b-sbar
mortality	b-np
costs	i-np
will	b-vp
decline	i-vp
or	o
that	b-sbar
I	b-np
will	b-vp
get	i-vp
some	b-np
sort	i-np
of	b-pp
dividend	b-np
bonus	i-np
after	b-pp
the	b-np
10th	i-np

Yet	o
Mr.	b-np

has	b-vp
turned	i-vp
the	b-np
import	i-np
phenomenon	i-np
to	b-pp
his	b-np
advantage	i-np
.	o

Early	b-advp
in	b-pp
the	b-np
decade	i-np
he	b-np
saw	b-vp
that	b-sbar
fur	b-np
workers	i-np
in	b-pp
many	b-np
foreign	i-np
countries	i-np
were	b-vp
willing	b-adjp

work	i-vp
longer	b-np

more	b-adjp

In	b-pp
1982	b-np

he	b-np
started	b-vp
a	b-np

also	b-advp
noticed	b-vp

introducing	i-vp
many	b-np
variations	i-np
on	b-pp
the	b-np
traditional	i-np

and	o
he	b-np
decided	b-vp

By	b-pp
combining	b-vp
his	b-np
strengths	i-np
in	b-pp

on	b-pp
foreign	b-np

six	b-np

stamping	b-vp

then	b-advp
the	b-np

turned	b-vp
into	b-pp
a	b-np
roar	i-np

And	o
no	b-np

was	b-vp
shouting	i-vp

No	b-np
one	i-np
around	b-pp
me	b-np

saying	i-vp
anything	b-np

Because	b-sbar
we	b-np
all	b-np

busy	b-adjp
riding	b-vp
a	b-np

Sixty	b-np

a	b-np

waiting	b-vp

the	b-np

Only	b-advp
at	b-pp
the	b-np
moment	i-np
of	b-pp
maximum	b-np
roll	i-np
did	o
I	b-np
grasp	b-vp
what	b-np
was	b-vp
going	i-vp
on	b-prt
.	o

Then	b-advp
I	b-np
remembered	b-vp
the	b-np
quake	i-np
of	b-pp

in	b-pp

When	b-advp
the	b-np

up	b-prt

Magic	i-np

had	b-vp
short-circuited	i-vp

Then	b-advp
I	b-np
noticed	b-vp
the	b-np
overhead	i-np
light	i-np
was	b-vp
swaying	i-vp
on	b-pp
its	b-np
cord	i-np
and	o
realized	b-vp
what	b-np
had	b-vp
happened	i-vp
.	o

What	b-np
should	o
I	b-np
do	b-vp
?	o

Get	b-vp
out	b-pp
of	b-pp
the	b-np
possibly	i-np
collapsing	i-np
building	i-np
to	b-pp
the	b-np
parking	i-np
lot	i-np
.	o

But	o
the	b-np
lot	i-np
might	b-vp
split	i-vp
into	b-pp
crevasses	b-np
,	o
so	o
I	b-np
had	b-vp
better	i-vp
stand	i-vp
on	b-pp
my	b-np
car	i-np
,	o
which	b-np
probably	b-advp
was	b-vp
wider	b-adjp
than	b-pp
the	b-np
average	i-np
crevasse	i-np
.	o

Fortunately	b-advp
,	o
the	b-np
quake	i-np
was	b-vp
over	b-advp
before	b-sbar
I	b-np
managed	b-vp
to	i-vp
run	i-vp
out	b-advp

stand	b-vp
naked	b-adjp
on	b-pp
the	b-np
hood	i-np

At	b-pp
the	b-np
Stick	i-np
,	o
while	b-sbar
the	b-np
world	i-np
shook	b-vp

I	b-np
thought	b-vp
of	b-pp

then	b-advp
it	b-np
struck	b-vp
me	b-np
that	b-sbar
this	b-np
time	i-np
was	b-vp
different	b-adjp

If	b-sbar
I	b-np
survived	b-vp

I	b-np
would	b-vp

What	b-np

How	b-advp

I	b-np
file	b-vp

All	b-np
these	i-np

occurred	b-vp

for	b-pp

While	b-sbar
this	b-np

simple	i-adjp
,	o
it	b-np
appears	b-vp
to	i-vp
explain	i-vp
several	b-np
things	i-np
.	o

First	b-advp
,	o
why	b-advp
ticket	b-np
splitting	i-np
has	b-vp
increased	i-vp
and	o
taken	b-vp
the	b-np
peculiar	i-np
pattern	i-np
that	b-np
it	b-np
has	b-vp
over	b-pp
the	b-np
past	i-np
half	i-np
century	i-np
:	o
Prior	b-advp
to	b-pp
the	b-np
election	i-np
of	b-pp
Franklin	b-np
Roosevelt	i-np
as	b-pp
president	b-np
and	o
the	b-np
advent	i-np
of	b-pp
the	b-np
New	i-np
Deal	i-np
,	o
government	b-np
occupied	b-vp
a	b-np
much	i-np
smaller	i-np
role	i-np
in	b-pp
society	b-np
and	o
the	b-np
prisoner	i-np
's	b-np
dilemma	i-np
problem	i-np
confronting	b-vp
voters	b-np
in	b-pp
races	b-np
for	b-pp
Congress	b-np
was	b-vp
considerably	b-adjp
less	i-adjp
severe	i-adjp
.	o

Second	b-advp
,	o
it	b-np
explains	b-vp
why	b-advp
voters	b-np
hold	b-vp
Congress	b-np
in	b-pp
disdain	b-np
but	o
generally	b-vp
love	i-vp
their	b-np
own	i-np
congressional	i-np
representatives	i-np
:	o
Any	b-np
individual	i-np
legislator	i-np
's	b-np
constituents	i-np
appreciate	b-vp
the	b-np
specific	i-np
benefits	i-np
that	b-np
the	b-np
legislator	i-np
wins	b-vp
for	b-pp
them	b-np
but	b-np
not	i-np
the	b-np
overall	i-np
cost	i-np
associated	b-vp
with	b-pp
every	b-np
other	i-np
legislator	i-np
doing	b-vp
likewise	b-advp
for	b-pp
his	b-np
own	i-np
constituency	i-np
.	o

Third	b-advp
,	o
the	b-np
theory	i-np
suggests	b-vp
why	b-advp
legislators	b-np
who	b-np
pay	b-vp
too	b-np
much	i-np
attention	i-np
to	b-pp
national	b-np
policy	i-np
making	i-np
relative	b-advp
to	b-pp
local	b-np
benefit-seeking	i-np
have	b-vp
lower	b-np
security	i-np
in	b-pp
office	b-np
.	o

For	b-pp
example	b-np
,	o
first-term	b-np
members	i-np
of	b-pp
the	b-np
House	i-np
,	o
once	b-advp
the	b-np
most	i-np
vulnerable	i-np
of	b-pp
incumbents	b-np
,	o
have	b-vp
become	i-vp
virtually	b-adjp
immune	i-adjp
to	b-pp
defeat	b-np
.	o

The	b-np
one	i-np
exception	i-np
to	b-pp
this	b-np
recent	i-np
trend	i-np
was	b-vp
the	b-np
defeat	i-np
of	b-pp
13	b-np
of	b-pp
the	b-np
52	i-np
freshman	i-np
Republicans	i-np
brought	b-vp
into	b-pp
office	b-np
in	b-pp
1980	b-np

the	b-np
Reagan	i-np
revolution	i-np
and	o
running	b-vp
for	b-pp
re-election	b-np
in	b-pp
1982	b-np
.	o

Because	b-sbar
these	b-np
freshmen	i-np
placed	b-vp
far	b-np
more	i-np
emphasis	i-np
on	b-pp
their	b-np
partisan	i-np
role	i-np
--	o
spreading	b-vp
the	b-np
Reagan	i-np
revolution	i-np
--	o
in	b-pp
national	b-np
policy	i-np
making	i-np
,	o
they	b-np
were	b-vp
more	b-adjp
vulnerable	i-adjp
to	b-pp
defeat	b-np
.	o

Fourth	b-advp
,	o
the	b-np
theory	i-np
indicates	b-vp
why	b-advp
the	b-np
Republican	i-np
Party	i-np
may	b-vp
have	i-vp
a	b-np
difficult	i-np
time	i-np
attracting	b-vp
viable	b-np
candidates	i-np
for	b-pp
congressional	b-np
office	i-np
.	o

Potential	b-np
candidates	i-np
may	b-vp
be	i-vp
discouraged	i-vp
from	b-pp
running	b-vp
less	b-advp
by	b-pp
the	b-np
congressional	i-np
salary	i-np
than	b-pp
by	b-pp
the	b-np
prospect	i-np
of	b-pp
defeat	b-np
at	b-pp
the	b-np
hands	i-np
of	b-pp
a	b-np
Democratic	i-np
opponent	i-np
.	o

To	b-pp
the	b-np
extent	i-np
that	b-sbar
potential	b-np
Republican	i-np
candidates	i-np
and	o
their	b-np
financial	i-np
backers	i-np
realize	b-vp
that	b-sbar
the	b-np
congressional	i-np
prisoner	i-np
's	b-np
dilemma	i-np
game	i-np
works	b-vp
to	b-pp
their	b-np
disadvantage	i-np
,	o
the	b-np
Republican	i-np
Party	i-np
will	b-vp
be	i-vp
hindered	i-vp
in	b-pp
its	b-np
attempts	i-np
to	b-vp
field	i-vp
a	b-np
competitive	i-np
slate	i-np
of	b-pp
congressional	b-np
candidates	i-np
.	o

Fifth	b-advp
,	o
the	b-np
theory	i-np
may	b-vp
provide	i-vp
at	b-advp
least	i-advp
a	b-np
partial	i-np
reason	i-np
for	b-pp
why	b-advp
ticket	b-np
splitting	i-np
has	b-vp
been	i-vp
particularly	i-vp
pronounced	i-vp
in	b-pp
the	b-np
South	i-np
.	o

To	b-pp
the	b-np
extent	i-np
that	b-sbar
Democratic	b-np
legislators	i-np
from	b-pp
the	b-np
South	i-np
have	b-vp
held	i-vp
a	b-np
disproportionate	i-np
share	i-np
of	b-pp
power	b-np
in	b-pp
Congress	b-np
since	b-pp
1932	b-np
and	o
have	b-vp
been	i-vp
able	b-adjp
to	b-vp
translate	i-vp
such	b-np
clout	i-np
into	b-pp
relatively	b-np
more	i-np
local	i-np
benefits	i-np
for	b-pp
their	b-np
respective	i-np
constituencies	i-np
,	o
voters	b-np
in	b-pp
the	b-np
South	i-np
have	b-vp
had	i-vp
an	b-np
especially	i-np
strong	i-np
incentive	i-np
to	b-vp
keep	i-vp
such	b-np
Democrats	i-np
in	b-pp
office	b-np
.	o

Finally	b-advp
,	o
the	b-np
theory	i-np
suggests	b-vp
why	b-advp
Republicans	b-np
generally	b-advp
have	b-vp
fared	i-vp
better	b-advp
in	b-pp
Senate	b-np
races	i-np
than	b-pp
in	b-pp
campaigns	b-np
for	b-pp
the	b-np
House	i-np
.	o

Since	b-sbar
local	b-np
benefit-seeking	i-np
matters	b-vp
more	b-advp
and	o
national	b-np
policy	i-np
making	i-np
matters	b-vp
less	b-advp
in	b-pp
the	b-np
lower	i-np
chamber	i-np
of	b-pp
Congress	b-np
,	o
this	b-np
is	b-vp
precisely	b-advp
the	b-np
pattern	i-np
one	b-np
would	b-vp
expect	i-vp
if	b-sbar
Republicans	b-np
are	b-vp
less	b-adjp
willing	i-adjp
to	b-vp
engage	i-vp
in	b-pp
local	b-np
benefit-seeking	i-np
than	b-pp
their	b-np
Democratic	i-np
counterparts	i-np
.	o

Is	o
there	b-np
any	b-np
empirical	i-np
support	i-np
for	b-pp
this	b-np
theory	i-np
?	o

Three	b-np
pieces	i-np
of	b-pp
evidence	b-np
corroborate	b-vp
the	b-np
key	i-np
assumption	i-np
that	b-sbar
Democratic	b-np
legislators	i-np
are	b-vp
more	b-adjp
willing	i-adjp
to	b-vp
engage	i-vp
in	b-pp
local	b-np
benefit-seeking	i-np
than	b-pp
their	b-np
Republican	i-np
colleagues	i-np
.	o

First	b-advp
,	o
economists	b-np
James	i-np
Bennett	i-np
and	i-np
Thomas	i-np
DiLorenzo	i-np
find	b-vp
that	b-sbar
GOP	b-np
senators	i-np
turn	b-vp
back	b-prt
roughly	b-np
10	i-np
%	i-np
more	b-np
of	b-pp
their	b-np
allocated	i-np
personal	i-np
staff	i-np
budgets	i-np
than	b-sbar
Democrats	b-np
do	b-vp
.	o

To	b-pp
the	b-np
extent	i-np
that	b-sbar
the	b-np
primary	i-np
duty	i-np
of	b-pp
personal	b-np
staff	i-np
involves	b-vp
local	b-np
benefit-seeking	i-np
,	o
this	b-np
indicates	b-vp
that	b-sbar
political	b-np
philosophy	i-np
leads	b-vp
congressional	b-np
Republicans	i-np
to	b-vp
pay	i-vp
less	b-np
attention	i-np
to	b-pp
narrow	b-np
constituent	i-np
concerns	i-np
.	o

Second	b-advp
,	o
if	b-sbar
the	b-np
key	i-np
assumption	i-np
is	b-vp
valid	b-adjp
,	o
Democrats	b-np
should	b-vp
have	i-vp
lower	b-np
attendance	i-np
rates	i-np
on	b-pp
roll-call	b-np
votes	i-np
than	b-sbar
Republicans	b-np
do	b-vp
to	b-pp
the	b-np
extent	i-np
that	b-sbar
such	b-np
votes	i-np
reflect	b-vp
national	b-np
policy	i-np
making	i-np
and	o
that	b-sbar
participating	b-vp
in	b-pp
such	b-np
votes	i-np
takes	b-vp
away	b-prt
from	b-pp
the	b-np
time	i-np
a	b-np
legislator	i-np
could	b-vp
otherwise	i-vp
devote	i-vp
to	b-pp
local	b-np
benefit-seeking	i-np
.	o

This	b-np
is	b-vp
indeed	b-advp
what	b-np
the	b-np
data	i-np
indicate	b-vp
,	o
particularly	b-advp
in	b-pp
the	b-np
case	i-np
of	b-pp
the	b-np
House	i-np

The	b-np

Finally	b-advp

The	b-np

the	b-np

a	b-np

The	b-np

there	b-np

suggestions	b-np

organizational	b-np
and	i-np
institutional	i-np
changes	i-np
,	o
for	b-pp
two	b-np
reasons	i-np
.	o

First	b-advp
,	o
its	b-np
position	i-np
in	b-pp
the	b-np
government	i-np
is	b-vp
anomalous	b-adjp
.	o

It	b-np
has	b-vp
an	b-np
unusual	i-np
kind	i-np
of	b-pp
independence	b-np
from	b-pp
elected	b-np
officials	i-np
and	o
still	b-vp
has	i-vp
authority	b-np
over	b-pp
one	b-np
of	b-pp
the	b-np
most	i-np
powerful	i-np
of	b-pp
government	b-np

instruments	i-np
--	o
the	b-np
control	i-np
of	b-pp
the	b-np
money	i-np
supply	i-np
.	o

Thus	b-advp
we	b-np
have	b-vp
a	b-np
condition	i-np
that	b-np
is	b-vp
easily	i-vp
described	i-vp
as	b-pp
undemocratic	b-adjp
.	o

Second	b-advp
,	o
the	b-np
responsibilities	i-np
of	b-pp
the	b-np
Federal	i-np
Reserve	i-np
as	b-pp
guardian	b-np
of	b-pp
the	b-np
currency	i-np
,	o
which	b-np
means	b-vp
as	b-pp
guardian	b-np
of	b-pp
the	b-np
stability	i-np
of	b-pp
the	b-np
price	i-np
level	i-np
,	o
sometimes	b-advp
lead	b-vp
it	b-np
to	b-vp
take	i-vp
measures	b-np
that	b-np
are	b-vp
unpopular	b-adjp
.	o

As	b-sbar
former	b-np
Fed	i-np
Chairman	i-np
William	i-np
McChesney	i-np
Martin	i-np
used	b-vp
to	i-vp
say	i-vp
,	o
they	b-np
would	b-vp
have	i-vp
to	i-vp
take	i-vp
the	b-np
punch	i-np
bowl	i-np
away	b-advp
just	b-advp
as	b-sbar
the	b-np
party	i-np
is	b-vp
getting	i-vp
interesting	b-adjp
.	o

So	o
the	b-np
Federal	i-np
Reserve	i-np
is	b-vp
an	b-np
attractive	i-np
target	i-np
for	b-pp
complaint	b-np
by	b-pp
politicians	b-np
.	o

The	b-np
Fed	i-np
is	b-vp
easily	i-vp
assigned	i-vp
the	b-np
blame	i-np
for	b-pp
unpleasantness	b-np
,	o
like	b-pp
high	b-np
interest	i-np
rates	i-np
or	o
slow	b-np
economic	i-np
growth	i-np
,	o
while	b-sbar
the	b-np
politicians	i-np
can	b-vp
escape	i-vp
responsibility	b-np
by	b-pp
pointing	b-vp
to	b-pp
the	b-np
Fed	i-np
's	b-np
independence	i-np

proposals	b-np

``	o

the	b-np

which	b-np
